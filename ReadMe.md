# SIG Systems Shell

This shell is the [UIC ACM](https://acmuic.org/)'s SIG Systems' first project!

## Guide to Getting Started
1. Use the [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) Rust installer to get your environment setup and ready to build the shell.
    - There are `rustup` installers available for Linux, Windows, and MacOS.
      - Linux and MacOS users need only to run a quick command.
2. Use `git clone` to clone this repo, then `cd` into it.
3. Run `cargo run` in your terminal to startup the (quite unfinished) shell.
4. Make some changes to `src/main.rs` then type `cargo run` again to see what changes!
